Achieves 61.5922% when epoch 1000 ;loss function gave 0.65857. 

Achieves 65.3823% when epoch 10 000; loss function gave 0.62886 (at 10k epoch it is only moving down by 0.00001 per 100 epochs, so could run through more times and push to over 70% accuracy, but probably not worth it. 
This is with learning_rate=0.01

Adjusting learning_rate to 0.02 and epoch to 10 000; loss function gives 0.62874 for epoch 9900. And it achieves 65.382308 % so roughly the exact same thing. Seems we have hit the max with this method.
